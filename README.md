This ticket was created by user Karen. This is what you will see on the backend of osTicket. I observed the ticket as Agent John to observe the ticket propertied who is also not an admin. Using John's profile, the ticket was then assigned to Jane who is an admin. With John, the ticket was set as Sev-A, and issued for the Online Banking Department which Jane is in.

I am now simulating communication between employees regarding this Severity-A ticket. Jane has commented that she will be taking over the ticket. Jane has then commented that she has some possible speculations on what the issue may be for the following ticket.

Now I am simply simulating that Jane has resolved the issue for the ticket and is reporting back to the team under the ticket thread.
